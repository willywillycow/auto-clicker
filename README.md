*This was an update to a small project I made a while ago, like 3 years prior. It's a small tool for automating mouse and keyboard inputs with Python.*

*The hotkey and inputting key may be set to multiple keys by pressing return / enter ‚èé after each input. To exit the session simply press on the button again.*

*The Mac version, due to recent MacOS changes, no longer function normally and is subjected for an update very soon.*
